@tjalanizle No man, at this level they needs more regulation on this sort of thing. A whole COUNTRY'S legacy is at stake. #replaysdontlie Jun 24, 2014 
The goal line replay system needs to be extended to questionable tackles and player disputes. Referees can't see everything. #imcallingFIFA Jun 24, 2014
